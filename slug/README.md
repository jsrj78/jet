# JET/Slug

My explorations into the world of ClojureScript, Figwheel, and Reagent.  
Each "slug" is a self-contained project where I _slowly_ try something new:

* [01-slug](01-slug) - Set up a Leiningen project with Figwheel (live coding), Reagent
  (React wrapper), and DevCards (web-based test environment). Based on the
  [reagent-figwheel](https://github.com/gadfly361/reagent-figwheel) template.
